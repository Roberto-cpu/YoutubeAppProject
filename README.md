# Mobile-Application-Porject
This repository will be used to manage the application for Mobile Application and Cloud Computing course

The application is based on the youtube reviews concept.
A user can log as an authenticated user or as a guest.
In the second case the user cannot enter a new review or a new comment, but can just watch the information saved into the app.
An authenticated user can store a new review about a not exsisting song or can add a comment about a saved song.
In the registration phase, the user must enter some information about itself and choose his profile image (photo or icon).
After the log in, the user will see the list of songs saved. This list can be filtered for genre.
The user can add a new song, and so a new review, or can open a song.
If the user wants to add a new song, he must enter the information about it, including the youtube link to play the song.
Instead, if he opens a song, he can play it on youtube and/or add a new comment as an answer to the principal review.
